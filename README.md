It's an end in itself and it's functionalities are senseless, but at least it has implementations about pratically all of Angular's basilar features.

Here there's a list of feathures:
-Basilar Components management and routing
-Silly use of services as static repositories (don't do it at home)
-events and hint of reactive programming
-Data binding (one wayed and two wayed)
-Child-to-Father and Father-to-Child data transfer
-Websocket or kinda of it {{Work In Progress!!!}}
